### Shiny app for Functional Generalized Additive Models
----------------
Functional Generalized Additive Models are a class of models we developed for flexible scalar on function regression.  The
approach is demonstrated here on a number of data sets using a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) app.  

The app can be viewed [here](https://fgam.shinyapps.io/fgam/).

You can also run the app locally with R using
```
library(shiny)
runGitHub("mwmclean/fgam-app")
```
